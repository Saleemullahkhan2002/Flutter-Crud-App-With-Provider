# crud_app_with_provider

A new Flutter project.

Description:
This Flutter app demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using the Provider package for state management. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete user data, which includes a name and an ID.

The app's home page displays a list of users, each with their name and ID. Users can edit a user's information by tapping on the edit button next to each user, which opens a dialog with text fields for editing the name and ID. Users can also delete a user by tapping on the delete button.

The app uses the Provider package to manage the app's state, ensuring that changes to the user data are reflected in the UI. This approach keeps the UI code clean and separates the data management logic from the presentation logic, making the app easier to maintain and scale.

Overall, this Flutter CRUD app with Provider demonstrates how to implement basic CRUD functionality in a Flutter app using a popular state management solution, providing a solid foundation for building more complex applications
